**LabSound GraphToy** is a workspace for exploring **LabSound** nodes and their properties.

![Example](resources/preview.png)

Right click on the canvas to create new nodes. Drag wires from outputs to inputs. Click the fields to edit the parameters and settings.

Some nodes, such as the Oscillator must be started before they make sound. These nodes will have a star icon near their name which can be clicked to activate them.

Some nodes, such as the Sfxr node can be signalled for a special behavior. This signal, as in PureData, is a *bang* and is represented near the node's name as an explanation point icon which can be click to emit the bang signal to the node.

## Getting Started

````sh
cd {source-location}
git clone --recursive {this-repo}
cd {build-location}
cmake -G {generator} -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX={install-location} {source-location}
{run build and install commands}
````

## In Progress

- [ ] Add a delete icon (red circle-x)
- [ ] Replace delete dialog boxes with red-circle-x that appears when the cursor hovers in an appropriate spot
- [ ] Add group selection
- [ ] Make canvas recursive, with left edge ins, and right edge outs
- [ ] Add function to turn group selection into a subgraph node
- [ ] Add expand subgraph canvas, and collapse. Levels of recursion visible as bars with in/out wiring on left and right
- [ ] Add breadcrumb in status bar to indicate canvas recursion level
- [ ] Create a viable save file format
- [ ] Load and parse a saved file
- [ ] Implement File/New
